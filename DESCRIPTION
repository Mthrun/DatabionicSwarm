Description: Algorithms implementing populations of agents that interact with one another and sense their environment may exhibit emergent behavior such as self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here, a swarm system called Databionic swarm (DBS) is introduced which was published in Thrun, M.C., Ultsch A.: "Swarm Intelligence for Self-Organized Clustering" (2020), Artificial Intelligence, <DOI:10.1016/j.artint.2020.103237>. DBS is able to adapt itself to structures of high-dimensional data such as natural clusters characterized by distance and/or density based structures in the data space. The first module is the parameter-free projection method called Pswarm (Pswarm()), which exploits the concepts of self-organization and emergence, game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry considerations. The second module is the parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique, which generates projected points on the topographic map with hypsometric tints defined by the generalized U-matrix (GeneratePswarmVisualization()). The third module is the clustering method itself with non-critical parameters (DBSclustering()). Clustering can be verified by the visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method as a whole. It enables even a non-professional in the field of data mining to apply its algorithms for visualization and/or clustering to data sets with completely different structures drawn from diverse research fields. The comparison to common projection methods can be found in the book of Thrun, M.C.: "Projection Based Clustering through Self-Organization and Swarm Intelligence" (2018) <DOI:10.1007/978-3-658-20540-9>.
