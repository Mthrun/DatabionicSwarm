\title{
Internal function: Dijkstra SSSP
}
\description{
Dijkstra's SSSP (Single source shortest path) algorithm:

gets the shortest path (geodesic distance) from source vertice(point) to all other vertices(points) defined by 
the edges of the adjasency matrix
}
\usage{
DijkstraSSSP(Adj, Costs, source)
}
\arguments{
\item{Adj}{[1:n,1:n] 0/1 adjascency matrix, e.g. from delaunay graph or gabriel
graph}
\item{Costs}{[1:n,1:n]   matrix, distances between n points (normally
euclidean)}
\item{source}{integer vertice(point) from which to calculate the geodesic
distance to all other points}
}
\details{
Preallocating space for DataStructures accordingly to the maximum possible number of vertices which is fixed set at 
the number 10001.
This is an internal function of \code{\link{ShortestGraphPathsC}}, no errors or mis-usage is caught here.
}
\value{
ShortestPaths[1:n] vector, shortest paths (geodesic) to all other vertices
including the source vertice itself}
