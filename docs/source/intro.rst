Introduction
============

**DBS** is a flexible and robust clustering framework that consists of three independent modules. The first module is the parameter-free projection method **Pswarm**, which exploits the concepts of self-organization and emergence, game theory, swarm intelligence and symmetry considerations. The second module is a parameter-free high-dimensional data visualization technique, which generates projected points on a topographic map with hypsometric colors, called the **generalized U-matrix**. The third module is a **clustering method** with no sensitive parameters. The clustering can be verified by the visualization and vice versa. The term DBS refers to the method as a whole. For further details, see Databionic swarm in [Thrun, 2018], chapter 8.
