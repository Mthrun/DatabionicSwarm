Version 1.3.0 (2023-10-30 GitHub)   
   o Major bugfix of Quirin Stier in calcStressC.cpp and PswarmCurrentRadiusC2botsPositive: swarm allows every databot to change position by checking a new index. Priorly, databot with index 0 was frozen in the projection.
   o RelativeDifference can now be called silent and as a bugfix for vectors x and y optional parameter are now used
   
Version 1.2.1 (2023-10-10 CRAN)   
   o Moved RobustNormalization and RobustNorm_BackTrafo to DataVisualizations package available on CRAN
   o Corrected and extended UniquePoints   
   o ClusteringAccuracy deleted. An improved version called ClusterAccuracy can be found in the FCPS package available on CRAN
   o DelaunayClassifiationError deleted. An new function with a better principle for evalaution the quality of DR methods called GabrielClassificationError can be found in the DRquality package available on CRAN.
		
Version 1.2.0 (2023-05-29 CRAN)
    o  GeneratePswarmVisualization reimplemented in a parallelized Cpp function, Pswarm will follow soon.

    
Version 1.1.7 (2023-01-31 GitHub)
    o Bugfix in UniquePoints by Quirin Stier
    o DBSclustering allows now to set title and xlab if dendrogramm is plottet
    o Delaunay4Points changed argument Grid to LC and within the function LC is converted to Grid
    
Version 1.1.6 (2022-11-26 CRAN)
    o Corrected notes of CRAN derived from documentation
    o Bugfixes in internal procedure of computing unique points for Delaunay4Points. Procedue is now available to the user as the function UniquePoints()	
    o Print() replaced with message() in Pswarm()
	
Version 1.1.5 (2020-10-28 CRAN)
    o Improved documentation significantly.
    o Pswarm now falls back to the dist function if the package parallelDist is not installed.
    o sESOM agorithm for the generalized Umatrix improved and is described now in the MethodsX publication of [Thrun/Ultsch, 2020]. It differs from the first publication of [Thrun, 2018].
	
Version 1.1.4 (2020-02-29 GitHub)
    o Bugfix:  checkInputDistancesOrData, DBSclustering, Pswarm, setGridSize and ShortestGraphPathsC: using unname in isSymmetric to check correctly of symmetric distance matrix
    o checkInputDistancesOrData is now used in RobustNormalization and Pswarm correctly and indicates in which function the errors lies.
    o Improvement: DBSclustering now provides the same colored branches (depending on frequency) as the topograpghcMap visualization with default colors. This makes a direct comparison of cluster structres more evident as it is clearly presented which projected point belongs to which high-dimensional point in the dendrogram.

Version 1.1.3 (2020-02-02 CRAN)
    o Bugfix: deleted dependcy rowr because it was taken down from CRAN.

Version 1.1.2 (2019-12-06 CRAN)
    o Improvement: DBSclustering has now a colored dendrogram using package dendextend.
    o RobustNorm_BackTrafo added: transforms the Robust Normalization back.
    o bugfix: Delaunay4Points uses inherits instead of class to check for matrix (see https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html)
		
Version 1.1.1 (2019-01-27 CRAN)
    o bugfix: RelativeDifference now stops if non finite values in either x and y expaining the error.
    o bugfix: RobustNormalization fixed in some special cases like non finite values.
    o NoLevels of GeneralizedUmatrix integrated for fast plotting.
	
Version 1.1.0 (2018-06-26 CRAN)
    o Delaunay Classification Error (DCE) added. DCE evaluates projection methods unbiased.
    
Version 1.0.7 (GitHub)
    o ClusteringAccuracy added. Given a prior Classification this function evaluates a clustering algorithm unbiased.
    o Now on GitHub.
    
Version 1.0.6 (Local)
	o Bugfix: error: Cube::operator(): index out of bounds
    
Version 1.0.5 (Local)
	o RelativeDifference added which calculates the difference of a positive x and y value in the range [-2,2].
    
Version 1.0.4 (Local)
    o Minor bugfixes
	o Vignette added
    
Version 1.0.3 (2018-05-06 CRAN)
    o Added distance methods of parallelDist package
