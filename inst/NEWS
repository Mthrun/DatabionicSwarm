Version 1.1.2 (2019-05-08 GitHub)
    o Improvement: DBSclustering has now a colored dendrogram.
    o RobustNorm_BackTrafo added: transforms the Robust Normalization back.
		
Version 1.1.1 (2019-01-27 CRAN)
    o bugfix: RelativeDifference now stops if non finite values in either x and y expaining the error
    o bugfix: RobustNormalization fixed in some special cases like non finite values.
    o NoLevels of GeneralizedUmatrix integrated for fast plotting.
	
Version 1.1.0 (2018-06-26 CRAN)
