Version 1.1.4 (2020-02-29 GitHub)
    o Bugfix:  checkInputDistancesOrData, DBSclustering, Pswarm, setGridSize and ShortestGraphPathsC: using unname in isSymmetric to check correctly of symmetric distance matrix
    o checkInputDistancesOrData is now used in RobustNormalization and Pswarm correctly and indicates in which function the errors lies.
    o Improvement: DBSclustering now provides the same colored branches (depending on frequency) as the topograpghcMap visualization with default colors. This makes a direct comparison of cluster structres more evident as it is clearly presented which projected point belongs to which high-dimensional point in the dendrogram.

Version 1.1.3 (2020-02-02 CRAN)
    o Bugfix: deleted dependcy rowr because it was taken down from CRAN.

Version 1.1.2 (2019-12-06 CRAN)
    o Improvement: DBSclustering has now a colored dendrogram using package dendextend.
    o RobustNorm_BackTrafo added: transforms the Robust Normalization back.
    o bugfix: Delaunay4Points uses inherits instead of class to check for matrix (see https://developer.r-project.org/Blog/public/2019/11/09/when-you-think-class.-think-again/index.html)
		
Version 1.1.1 (2019-01-27 CRAN)
    o bugfix: RelativeDifference now stops if non finite values in either x and y expaining the error.
    o bugfix: RobustNormalization fixed in some special cases like non finite values.
    o NoLevels of GeneralizedUmatrix integrated for fast plotting.
	
Version 1.1.0 (2018-06-26 CRAN)
    o Delaunay Classification Error (DCE) added. DCE evaluates projection methods unbiased.
    
Version 1.0.7 (GitHub)
    o ClusteringAccuracy added. Given a prior Classification this function evaluates a clustering algorithm unbiased.
    o Now on GitHub.
    
Version 1.0.6 (Local)
	o Bugfix: error: Cube::operator(): index out of bounds
    
Version 1.0.5 (Local)
	o RelativeDifference added which calculates the difference of a positive x and y value in the range [-2,2].
    
Version 1.0.4 (Local)
    o Minor bugfixes
	o Vignette added
    
Version 1.0.3 (2018-05-06 CRAN)
    o Added distance methods of ParallelCpp package
